# Langchain Integration with OpenAI API in Streamlit Demo

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of Langchain, an NLP framework, with the OpenAI API within a Streamlit application. Langchain allows you to create conversational AI models and sequential chains of language processing steps easily. By leveraging the OpenAI API, you can enhance your language models with powerful AI capabilities.
